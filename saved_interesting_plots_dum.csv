0,Correlation,Show relationships between two <p class='highlight-descriptor'>quantitative</p> attributes.,"Correlation searches through all pairwise relationship between two quantitative attributes             (e.g., severityMax, severityScore). The visualizations are ranked from most to least linearly correlated based on                 their Pearsonâ€™s correlation score.","[<Vis  (x: severityScore        , y: severityMax          ) mark: scatter, score: 1.00 >,

1,Distribution,Show univariate histograms of <p class='highlight-descriptor'>quantitative</p>  attributes.,"Distribution displays univariate histogram distributions of all quantitative attributes (e.g., population_size).

2,Occurrence,Show frequency of occurrence for <p class='highlight-descriptor'>categorical</p> attributes.,"Occurence displays bar charts of counts for all categorical attributes (e.g., Unnamed: 0). Visualizations are ranked from most to least uneven across the bars. ","[<Vis  (x: COUNT(Record), y: pctStateAffected) mark: bar, score: 0.24 >,

3,Temporal,Show trends over <p class='highlight-descriptor'>time-related</p> attributes.,"Temporal displays line charts for all attributes related to datetimes in the dataframe. Lux displays the overall temporal trend first, followed by trends across other timescales (e.g., year, month, week, day).","[<Vis  (x: dateBefore              , y: COUNT(Record)) mark: line, score: 5.00 >,

4,Geographical,Show choropleth maps of <p class='highlight-descriptor'>geographic</p> attributes,"Occurence displays choropleths of averages for some geographic attribute (e.g., State). Visualizations are ranked by diversity of the geographic attribute.","[<Vis  (x: State, y: MEAN(severityMax)          ) mark: geographical, score: 50.00 >,
