0,Correlation,Show relationships between two <p class='highlight-descriptor'>quantitative</p> attributes.,"Correlation searches through all pairwise relationship between two quantitative attributes             (e.g., population_size, state_population_size). The visualizations are ranked from most to least linearly correlated based on                 their Pearsonâ€™s correlation score.","[<Vis  (x: severityScore        , y: severityMax          ) mark: scatter, score: 1.00 >,

1,Distribution,Show univariate histograms of <p class='highlight-descriptor'>quantitative</p>  attributes.,"Distribution displays univariate histogram distributions of all quantitative attributes (e.g., population_size).

2,Occurrence,Show frequency of occurrence for <p class='highlight-descriptor'>categorical</p> attributes.,"Occurence displays bar charts of counts for all categorical attributes (e.g., dateBefore). Visualizations are ranked from most to least uneven across the bars. ","[<Vis  (x: COUNT(Record), y: pctStateAffected) mark: bar, score: 0.39 >,

3,Geographical,Show choropleth maps of <p class='highlight-descriptor'>geographic</p> attributes,"Occurence displays choropleths of averages for some geographic attribute (e.g., State). Visualizations are ranked by diversity of the geographic attribute.","[<Vis  (x: State, y: MEAN(population_size)      ) mark: geographical, score: 50.00 >,
